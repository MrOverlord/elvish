The Elvish community follows the
[Go community code of conduct](https://go.dev/conduct).

Since we don't have a team of stewards or a committee of representatives (yet),
if you encounter an issue, please contact xiaq via Telegram, Matrix or Discord
DM or email (xiaqqaix@gmail.com).

Consistent with the Go community code of conduct, the following specific points
apply:

-   Respect how other people choose to use Elvish and their system in general.

    Elvish is opinionated software, but that doesn't mean the use cases Elvish
    chooses not to support are inherently bad.
